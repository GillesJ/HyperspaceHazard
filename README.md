# HyperspaceHazard
A space-themed adventure board game written in Java for our Basic Programming class at the KULeuven.


If you are a student following the same course: do not copy the source code! The CS department uses a state-of-the-art source code plagiarism engine so refactoring will not work either. Feel free to use our source as inspiration for your own homework, however, be aware that our solution was not found to be ideal in some details by the evaluator (we still got graded 90% though).

The game is programmed in the model-view-controller paradigm and features a randomly initialized gameboard with enemies of various types. The GUI and board are made using the Swing library. The player has to manage fuel-cost for movement on the board and can mine planeto√Øds to gain fuel or level up. Hyperspace Hazard also has a rudimentary combat-system with a hitpoints, attack and defense stats for the player ship.

A report with details on the design,class and object descriptions, and a UML diagram are included below.
